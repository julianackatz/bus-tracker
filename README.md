# Bus Tracker Exercise

**Intro**

This is a sample of an exercise done during the MIT Professional Certificate in Coding.

The professor provided an initial code and this is the result.

**Instructions to see marker moving**

Click on the left hand side button that reads "Show Stops between MIT and Harvard"

The marker on the map will start moving and stop at each bus stop.

In order for the code to work, you need to sign up at <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">https://www.mapbox.com</a> and get a token key. Once you have your token, replace it on the file "mapanimation.js" line 2.
